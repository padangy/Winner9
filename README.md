This is a simple version of the casino baccarat card game that deals 3 cards to two Players (p-vs-computer) from one deck of 52 cards. This game is decided with 3 round wins, with tie rounds not counting. The winner for one round is whomever has their 3 cards add up to 9. 10-J-Q-K cards, and any value of 10 added up, have 0 point value. Ace has 1 point value. Every round, the Player can choose to trade one card that they have with the computer until the player is satisfied, up to a maximum of 3 trades per round.  9 being the highest, the highest value of the 3 cards' value wins. 

This game was built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
